\chapter{Introduction}   \label{chap:intro}

%overall background
Smartphones with cellular data access have become increasingly popular across the globe, with the wide deployment of 3G and emerging LTE~\cite{3gpp.lte} networks, and a plethora of applications of all kinds. In the third quarter of 2009, the global smartphone shipments reached 41.4 million units~\cite{smartphoneStat}. As of the third quarter of 2012, the global smartphone shipments reached 173.7 million~\cite{smartphoneStat2} with 61.3\% year-on-year increase in average. It is expected that in the next few years smartphone sales will continue to grow.  Vendors, such as Samsung, Apple, and HTC offer a variety of smartphones equipped with increasingly faster CPUs and larger memory, though still lagging behind desktop or laptop systems. With access to various high-speed 3G networks, such as EVDO and UMTS, and the LTE 4G networks, they are powerful enough to run modern operating systems and sophisticated network applications such as web browsing, email, and streaming media. 

Why do we care both network performance and energy efficiency: they are important tradeoffs in cellular networks. in some cases, if you want to save more power, the network performance may become lower.
