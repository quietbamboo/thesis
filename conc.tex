\nsection{Future Research Agenda}

As future directions, we will continue and extend my previous works in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Cellular Network Performance Characterization.} We will continue the development \emph{MobiPerf} and make it into a general mobile measurement platform that can benefit the entire research community. In addition, we will make use of the data set collected by \emph{MobiPerf} to make more analysis on cellular network performance and this data set~\cite{mobiperf.data} is also available for other researchers.
\item \emph{Energy Optimization for Cellular Networks.} We will extend the inter-burst time prediction framework and implement it as a real functioning system on Android and use fast dormancy to save energy for end users. In addition, we will improve the prediction algorithm to consider TCP-level and application level context, which may further increase the prediction accuracy.
\item \emph{Effect of Network Protocol and Application Behavior on Performance for LTE Networks}. We will improve the design of the bandwidth estimation algorithm that we used to quantify the network utilization ratio of existing applications in the LTE networks. We will also explore the predictability of the available bandwidth in the LTE networks and study its implications and applications.
\end{itemize}
