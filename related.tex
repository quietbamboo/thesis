+ on network performance characterization

Our work is inspired by the Netdiff system~\cite{Mahajan:NSDI2008:NetDiff},
which established a benchmark for comparing performance of different
ISPs. In our research, we attempt to establish an equivalent benchmark for 
comparing network application performance on smartphones. Although some
online comparisons are available, such as Speedtest.net~\cite{speedtestnet} 
and FCC's broadband test~\cite{fccspeedtest}, which measure throughput and 
latency in 3G networks,  \mobiperf covers a more comprehensive set of 
metrics, including DNS lookup, Ping to the first hop, TCP handshake, and HTTP request to landmark servers.
Tan \etal carried out a similar measurement study on multiple commercial
3G networks~\cite{wltan07}. However, their study is limited to one location
(Hong Kong) and a few devices. Compared with their study, 
our work covers significantly more users from many different locations.
